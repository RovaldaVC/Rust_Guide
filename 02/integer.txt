## in rust you must specify the type of integer you want to use. There are two types of integers: signed and unsigned.

1. Signed integers (i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize)
Can store both positive and negative numbers.
One bit is used to represent the sign (positive/negative).
Example:
i8 → 8 bits → range: –128 to +127

2. Unsigned integers (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize)
Can only store non-negative numbers (0 and up).
Since no bit is wasted on the sign, all bits are used for magnitude.
Example:
u8 → 8 bits → range: 0 to 255
Quick contrast (8-bit case)
i8: –128 … +127
u8: 0 … 255
Same 8 bits, but unsigned squeezes out more positive range by sacrificing the negatives.

So when to use what?
Use signed when negative values make sense (temperature, bank account balance).
Use unsigned when only non-negative values exist (array indexes, sizes, counts).
