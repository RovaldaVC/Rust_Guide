First, that enum you wrote is actually built into Rust ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to define it, but it‚Äôs exactly how it works under the hood:
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}


T is a generic type (it can be anything: i32, String, f64, your custom struct, etc.).
Option<T> means: a value might exist (Some) or it might not (None).

Example 1: A value is present
let x: Option<i32> = Some(5);

x is an Option<i32>.
Right now, it contains Some(5).

Example 2: A value is missing
let y: Option<i32> = None;

y is still an Option<i32>.
But it holds no value (None).

Why is this useful?
Because in other languages (like Python, JavaScript, C), if something might not exist, you usually get null / None / undefined / some garbage.
That leads to null pointer bugs (the most common error in programming history).

Rust fixes this with Option<T>:
You can‚Äôt just use the value directly, the compiler forces you to handle both cases (Some or None).
This way you must deal with the possibility of missing values, instead of pretending they don‚Äôt exist.

Example with match:
let maybe_number: Option<i32> = Some(10);
match maybe_number {
    Some(n) => println!("The number is {n}"),
    None => println!("No number found"),
}

This guarantees you cover both cases.

üëâ So, in short:
Option<T> = a safe wrapper for ‚Äúmaybe a value, maybe not.‚Äù
Some(T) = we have the value.
None = no value.

The compiler forces you to handle both, which kills a whole category of bugs.
