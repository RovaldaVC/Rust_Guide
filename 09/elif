In Rust, there’s no elif. You just write else if—two words:

fn main() {
    let age = 20;

    if age < 16 {
        println!("You are too young to drive.");
    } else if age < 18 {
        println!("You can drive a bike, but not a car.");
    } else {
        println!("You can drive a car!");
    }
}


else if works exactly like Python’s elif.
You can chain as many else if blocks as you need.
The final else is optional.
So Rust’s version is slightly more verbose, but functionally identical.
