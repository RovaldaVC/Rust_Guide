to compile this program there are two options:

1️⃣ Using rustc directly
rustc hello.rs → compiles a single Rust file into an executable (hello.exe on Windows).
./hello → runs the compiled program.

✅ Good for tiny, single-file programs.
❌ Not ideal for larger projects with multiple files or dependencies.

2️⃣ Using Cargo (Rust’s package manager & build system)
cargo new project_name → creates a new Rust project with a folder structure, Cargo.toml (for dependencies), and a main.rs file.
cd project_name → go into the project folder.
cargo run → automatically compiles and runs the project.

✅ Handles multiple files, dependencies, and builds automatically.
✅ Recommended for almost all Rust projects.
