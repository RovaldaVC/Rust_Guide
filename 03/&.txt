what is & and how to use it in Rust?

imagine if i have a value but i want to create another value that can point to the same memory location where the first value is stored.
for that we use &.
& means i dont want to copy the value of the pervious variable for my new variable just let me use the reference.

example:
let x = 5;
let y = &x;

now y is a reference to x, so if i change x, y will also change.
so y doesnt copy the value of x, it just points to the same memory location as x.

now read compound_data_types.txt
