No requirements needed you can read that file.

there are two ways to create a string in Rust:

1 : .to_string() → shorthand, flexible.
example:
let s = "hello".to_string();

2: String::from() → explicit, beginner-friendly, often preferred in docs for clarity.
example:
let s = String::from("hello");

the fact is i feel like the beginner friendly is actuallu harder..
