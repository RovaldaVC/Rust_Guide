Compound data types
These are the molecules you build from the atoms. They group multiple values into one type.

Rust gives you two built-in compound types:

1. Tuple
Fixed size, can hold values of different types.
Example:
let tup: (i32, f64, char) = (500, 6.4, 'a');
let (x, y, z) = tup; // destructuring
println!("{}", y);   // 6.4

2. Array
Fixed size, all elements must be the same type.
Example:
let arr: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
println!("{}", arr[0]); // 1

for Array we use [] and for Tuple we use ().
for array we use ; and for tuple we use , to separate the values.
